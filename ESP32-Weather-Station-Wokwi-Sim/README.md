Project Description
This is a simulated weather station project built on an ESP32 microcontroller using Wokwi, an online electronics simulator. The project showcases how to interface with common sensors and display data on an OLED screen, all within a virtual environment.

The weather station reads temperature and humidity from a virtual DHT22 sensor and presents this data in real-time on a virtual SSD1306 OLED display. The project code, written in the Arduino framework, handles sensor communication, data processing, and display management.

This project is a great demonstration of embedded systems development and is a complete, self-contained portfolio piece that can be viewed and run by anyone with a web browser. It proves skills in:

Microcontroller programming (C++).

Sensor integration.

I2C communication with the OLED display.

Problem-solving in a simulated environment.

The inclusion of the Wokwi link makes it easy for recruiters and others to see the project in action without having to download or set up any tools.
